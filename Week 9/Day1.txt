cloud - Internet based compute power

EC2 S3 SInS

region - A Group of Availability Zones
availability zone - each individual zone that can be used with its own infrastructure
edge location - local cache for access
backbone - The large scale private infranet that AWS owns
caching - Storing temporary data in a faster to access way

cost explorer - shows a breakdown of where your costs went after using it
budgets - help prevent you overspending on services by actively lowering usage as needed

Six pillars of well architected- 
	sustainability - Minimizes environmental impacts of the cloud
	cost optimization - Achieve business outcomes while minimizing costs
	performance efficency - Run services efficiently and scalably
	reliability - Services are resilient to disruptions (Fault Isolation / Limits)
	security - How secure your infrastructure on the cloud is
	operational excellence - How well you work on aws Automation

cloudFormation allows you to setup and update a stack 
and allows you to easily create copies of stacks
