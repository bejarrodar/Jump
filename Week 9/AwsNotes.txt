AWS Saying
	Security is priority 0 at AWS

Shared Responsibility Model
	AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud - pysical and networking security
	Customer is responsible for security in the cloud - Proper configuration of services and software
	
3 Core Security Concepts - 
	IAM(Identity and Access Managment) - 
		User Managment
	Network Security - 
		Firewalls
	Data Encryption - 
		Data at rest/ Data in transit

Module 1 Basic of Cloud Computing

	Benifits of cloud computing
		Access sevices on demand
		avoid large upfront investments
		provision computing resources as needed
		Pay only for what you use

	Cloud based (Public)
		run everything in cloud
		migrate existing to cloud
		design and build new apps in cloud
	on-premis(Private)
		Run all parts on own servers
	Hybrid
		Some parts of the system is on the cloud 
		others are stored on premis



	Variable expenses
		upfront expenses
			invest in tech resouses before you can start
		variable expenses
			Allows quickly and easily changing what you use

	Econimies of scale
		Lower prices because a large number of users use the service

	Speed and Agility
		Can get resources in a matter of minutes
		Can go Global in minutes

	Core Services
		Compute
		Networking and Content delivery
		Storage
		Database
		Security, Identity, and Complience
		Management and Governance

Module 2 - Compute in the Cloud
	
	EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
		AWS Virtual Machine
		
	EC2 benifits
		Use secure sizable compute copacity
		Boot server instances in minutes
		Pay only for what you use
	
	EC2 instance types
		General Purpose - Provides a balance of Compute, Memory, and Networking
		Compute Optimized - designed for compute bound apps that benifit from high performance CPU
		Memory Optimized - Large datasets in memory 
		Accelerated Computing - Hardware accelerators, have graphic capabilities
		Storage Optimized - high sequential read and writes (IOPS)
	
	AMI Amazon Machine Image
		Application and OS Images
		Venders that have extra Applications preinstalled
	
	EC2 Billing Options
		On-Demand - 
			No upfront cost 
			Ideal for short term irregular Workloads
		Compute Savings plan - 
			Offers up to 66% savings over on demand 
			Requires a 1 or 3 year term commitment
		Reserved - 
			Billing Discount over on-demand
			requires 1 or 3 year commitment
		Spot - 
			Ideal for workloads with flexable start/end times
			Savings over on-demand
			AWS randomly turns on and off
		Dedicate Instance -
			More Expensive
			Single customer CPU Set
		Dedicated Host - 
			Most Expensive
			Single Customer Server
	
	EC2 Auto Scaling
		Use dynamic scaling and predictive scaling
		Scale capacity as computing requirments change
		Dynamic scaling uses cloudwatch for scaling
		predictive sets up times that are normally active to scale
	
		Auto scaling group - 
			Has minimum, desired, maximum
	
	ELB Elastic Load Balancing
		Works together with scaling to balance loads across nodes
		Acts as single point of contact
		Automatically distributes traffic across multiple resources
		performs health checks on the resource before sending traffic
	
	ELB Uses
		Load balancer does mot trigger auto scaling thats CloudWatch
		Works with the resources it has available
	
	Monolitic is a group of services that are all part of the app
	Microservices break up the services so if one goes down they don't all go down
	
	AWS Communication Services
	
	SNS vs SQS
		Simple Notification Service(SNS) - 
			Messages are published to topics
			Subscribers immediatly recieve messages for their topic
			Publisher Subscriber (PubSub) service
			Subscribers job to subscribe to topic
			Can send text or emails notifications can also be done
		Simple Queue Service(SQS) - 
			Send, Store, and recieve messages between components
			Queue messages without requiring other services to be available
			can store messages in order they are recieved
	
	Serverless compute services
		Server are not the concern of the client its AWS concern
		Allows the user to just worry with code
		Cost optimization from it getting automatically turned on and off
		Lambda - 
			Run code without managing servers
			pay only for compute time while code is running
			use other AWS services to automatically trigger code
			Can be chained to other Lambdas
	
	AWS Container Services
		Containers are lightweight
		
	Elastic Container Service (ECS)
		Run and scale containerized Apps
		Simple API calls to control
		Docker like Containers
	Elastic Kuberneties Service (EKS)
		Runs kubernety Containers
	AWS Fargate
		serverless containers

Module 4 Networking
	
	VPC Virtual Private Cloud
		Enables you to launch resources in a virtual network
		Contained in a Region
	Subnet
		Subset of adresses allocated to VPC
		Can be public or Private
		contained in a Availability Zone
	Internet Gateway
		Allows Access to a VPC from the Internet
	Route
		Routes Traffic around a VPC
	Virtual Private Gateway
		Allows private access through VPN
		Used for Employees to access network
	AWS Direct Connect
		Private connect 
		Dedicated Permenent Connection to the data center
		Needs A physical connection installed by AWS
	
	Network Access Control list and security groups
		--Explicit Denial Is only Done at NACL
		NACL
			Between subnet and internet gateway
			Is a Firewall
			filters traffic going to a subnet
			the default NACL allows all inbound/outbound
			Stateless packet filtering 
				Gets checked both in and out
			Have an Allow/Deny list
		Security Group 
			Inside a subnet
			Also a firewall
			filters traffic going to services like EC2
			by default denies all inbound/outbound
			Statefull packet filtering
				They remember previous decisions about packets
				AKA if request is let in the response is allowed out
			Acts as a whitelist so only the things on the list are allowed
	Set Public IP
		NLB - Network Load Balancer
		NAT
		EIP
		Route 53
	Route 53
        Load balance at region level
		Resolves domain names to IP
		Performs health checks
		can route based on 
			location 
			health
			proximity
			latency
			weighted - allows percentile control of traffic
			multivalue - combination of the above
	VPC peering
		Allows 2 VPC to talk to each other
		No transitive relationship
			AKA cant talk through childs Peering Connection
	Route Table
		each subnet can only have one route table but a rout table can connect to many subnets
		Main route table
			Can be changed
			Should not normally be changed
			implicitly routes subnets to one another without need you to
			breaks the only one route table per subnet rule
		
Module 5 - Storage and Databases
	
	Databases Have query tools and functions
	Storage is less structured
	Storage
		Block storage
		Object storage
		file storage
		block storage
			Files seperated into different blocks
			Fastest storage
		Object/File storage
			Slower storage
			File saved as whole peice
			Great for Mass parallel use
		EBS - elastic block Store 
			Can only be used with EC2
			only connects to single EC2 at a time
			Fixed size
		EFS - Elastic File Storage
			Like EBS only for use with EC2
			Can connect to multiple EC2 at a time
			Scalable size
			for Unix based systems
		FSx 
			Only works for Windows
			But the same as EFS
		S3 - Simple Storage Service
			Object storage
			Object consists of
				Data - Data in File
				MetaData - Data about file
				Key - Name of file
			Stores Objects in buckets
			Set permissions to control access
			Choose from a range of storage classes for different cases
			Not VPC bound aka Serverless
			Storage class applies for each individule object
			Storage Classes
				Standard
					For frequently accessed
					minimum of three avilability zones
				Standard IA
					Infrequent Access
					Similar to S3 Standard
					lower storage price 
					higher retrieval price
				One Zone IA
					Single availability Zone
					Lower Storage price then Standard IA
				Intelligent Tiering
					Best for data with unknown or changing pattern of use
					Requires a small fee per object to auto manage file
				Glacier
					Low cost
					for archiving
					retrieve in a few minutes to hours
				Glacier Deep
					Lowest Cost
					For archiving
					Could take up to 12 hours to retrieve
			AWS S3 Life cycle policies
